# A wording test is the easiest kind to write so that it can never fail: pin a
# string that is already everywhere, or look in a file that cannot not contain
# it. So for every property tests/rules_text_test.sh claims to check, this
# copies the repository into a temporary directory, breaks that one property,
# and runs the suite against the copy. The suite MUST fail.
#
# The real repository is only ever read. Everything written lives in a
# temporary directory this run creates and removes.
