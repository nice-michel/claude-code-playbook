# Seven suites, in the order that makes a failure easiest to read:
#
#   check_local_test         what scripts/check-local.sh does
#   dead_words_vectors_test  the conformance vectors shared with codex-playbook,
#                            and the cases one vector line cannot express
#   mutation_test            proof that the two suites above catch a broken
#                            script
#   rules_text_test          the local layer's hooks, the bundle's shape,
#                            the templates, INSTALL.md's counts
#   rules_text_mutation_test proof that the suite above catches a broken rulebook
#   install_preflight_test  migration and uninstall refuse active local paths
#   worktree_inventory_test rule 13.7's inventory script, read-only, on fixture repos
#
# Exits 0 only if all seven pass. Each suite creates and removes its own
# temporary directory; no real home directory is read or written.
