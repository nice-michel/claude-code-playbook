# 11 · Linux — platform commands

*This is the platform half of the rules — read it when a rule says "your platform file gives the command."*

**Only the file for this machine's operating system is installed. Never carry a command across from another platform file:** a command that works on one is frequently absent or subtly different on another, and that is how a safety check silently stops checking.

## 1. Is this port free?

| Need | Command |
|---|---|
| List all listening sockets | `ss -tlnp` (add `sudo` to see the owning process name/PID; `-6` sockets are included by default) |
| Fallback if `ss` is missing | `lsof -i -P -n \| grep LISTEN` |
| Check one specific port | `ss -tlnp \| grep ':<PORT> '` or `lsof -i :<PORT>` |

No output for that port = free.

## 2. Host capacity before a fan-out

| Measurement | Command | Reading it |
|---|---|---|
| Logical CPU count | `nproc` | a plain integer |
| Current load | `cat /proc/loadavg` | first three fields are the 1/5/15-minute load averages; divide the one you use by `nproc` to get the load factor SUBAGENTS.md's formula wants |
| Free disk | `df -h <path>` | read `Avail` and `Use%` for the filesystem holding `<path>` — the working filesystem, not `/` by habit |
| Memory-backed filesystems | `df -h /dev/shm` and `findmnt -t tmpfs -o TARGET,SIZE,USED` | what a `tmpfs` holds is RAM, not disk: it is the `shared` column of `free -m`, and a large `shared` beside a small `available` is a RAM-backed folder eating the machine. Rule 13.5 runs hygiene when one is more than a quarter full. |
| Is a path memory-backed? | `findmnt -T <path> -o FSTYPE` | `tmpfs` or `ramfs` means yes: never a build target or large scratch there (rule 13.4) |
| Is the swap a RAM-backed folder? | `grep -E 'Shmem\|SwapTotal\|SwapFree' /proc/meminfo`, then `grep VmSwap /proc/*/status` summed | swap full while processes' own `VmSwap` adds up to little means the swapped pages are `tmpfs` contents, not process memory: find the folder with `findmnt -t tmpfs` and `du`, and the swap drains only when it goes. **On WSL, `/mnt/wsl` is a `tmpfs` too**, as large as `/dev/shm`, and easy to miss (2026-10-17: a 45 GB cargo target there kept a 32 GB swap full for a day; removing it took swap from 32.7 to 9.4 GB). |
| Free memory | `free -m` | read the `available` column, not `free` — it already accounts for reclaimable cache/buffers |

## 3. Hash a file

- Digest: `sha256sum <file>` — the first field of the output is the hex digest.
- Size and modification time: `stat -c '%s %Y %y' <file>` — `%s` is bytes, `%Y` is the epoch mtime, `%y` is the human-readable mtime.

## 4. A private directory only I can read (the quarantine root)

- Create it owner-only: `mkdir -p -m 700 <dir>`
- Verify afterward: `stat -c '%a %U' <dir>` should print `700 <your-username>`; `ls -ld <dir>` shows the same thing as `drwx------`.

## 5. Process holding a port / still alive / stop it

Inspect before you terminate:

1. Who holds the port: `ss -tlnp | grep ':<PORT> '` (PID and process name are in the last column) or `lsof -i :<PORT>`
2. Is it still alive: `kill -0 <PID>` — exit status `0` with no output means alive; "No such process" means it's already gone. `ps -p <PID>` works too and shows the command line.
3. Stop it: `kill <PID>` first (SIGTERM, lets it clean up); only if it doesn't exit, `kill -9 <PID>` or `pkill -9 -f <pattern>` for a name-matched kill.
4. Is a process using a directory — before removing build output or a worktree: `lsof +D <dir>` lists every process with a file open anywhere under it, including a working directory (recursive, so slow on a large tree); `fuser -v <dir>` checks only the directory itself. The output is the signal — `lsof` can exit 1 even when it prints matches. Run it as the user who owns the processes, because it may not see other users' processes, and also look for a build tool running in the project (`pgrep -af 'cargo|npm|node|python|make'`): a build between compile steps holds nothing open under its output folder. Nothing printed by any of these means nothing was found, not proof of idleness.

## 6. Conventional paths on this OS

| Purpose | Path |
|---|---|
| Per-user config directory | `~/.config/` |
| Quarantine root | `~/.quarantine/` (per QUARANTINE.md) |

## 7. Atomic move

`mv <src> <dst>` is atomic when both paths sit on the same filesystem — it's a single `rename(2)` syscall, so there's no window where the file is half-written or missing.

**Caveat:** across filesystems (a different mount point, a bind-mounted volume, an overlay boundary) the kernel can't rename across devices, so `mv` silently falls back to copy-then-delete — no longer atomic, and a crash mid-copy can leave a partial file at the destination. Check first with `stat -c %d <src>` and `stat -c %d <dst-dir>` — if the device IDs differ, you're not getting atomicity. Keep the quarantine root on the same filesystem as anything you intend to move into it.
