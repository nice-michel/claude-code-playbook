# Handoff

**Current seam tape:** [`docs/handoffs/2026-10-05-upstream-sync-and-instruction-budget.md`](docs/handoffs/2026-10-05-upstream-sync-and-instruction-budget.md).
Where we are in three lines: fork synced to upstream 0.1.25. The instruction-budget plan
(`docs/plans/2026-10-05-instruction-budget-plan.md`) is parked until the host is idle.
Next: check its start gate, then split the otel-mtls `CLAUDE.md` (Task 1).
Previous tape: `docs/handoffs/2026-09-29-hygiene-back-to-back-and-installs.md`.

**Owner installation, 2026-09-28:** 0.1.22 installed (backup `~/.claude/rules.backup-2026-09-28-171612/`), byte-identical to `checkpoint/0.1.22`, local layer 6/6. The Codex edition 0.1.7 ports hygiene and back-to-back tasks and is installed too, with the owner's first Codex local layer.

**0.1.22, 2026-09-28:** every platform file says how to find a process using a directory (a gap the Codex edition's review found in section 13's idle check).

**0.1.21, 2026-09-27:** section 13, Hygiene (ADR 0014). The behaviour-suite
plan's ADR numbers move up by one (now 0016–0020) when it is recorded.

**0.1.20, 2026-09-27:** refused means stop; worktrees removed through git.
The behaviour-suite plan (`docs/plans/2026-09-26-behaviour-suite-plan.md`) is
approved in scope; its size (small / lean / full) awaits the owner.
**0.1.19, 2026-09-26:** economy mode for code review (ADR 0013).
**0.1.18, 2026-09-26:** loading measured and the out-of-project gap closed
(ADR 0012, `docs/reports/2026-09-26-loading-measurements.md`); the tip before it,
0.1.17, is the context-budget change (ADR 0011).
The owner's live installation was migrated and updated to 0.1.21 on 2026-09-28,
with the owner's go: `rules/MAI.md` folded word for word into `LOCAL.md` as rule
M.1 (original kept in `~/.claude/rules-backups/`), the `unsafe` review exception
dropped (a local layer may not relax a protection), four Overrides given
verifiers; installed files byte-identical to `checkpoint/0.1.21`, staleness
check 6/6. Backup: `~/.claude/rules.backup-2026-09-28-153215/`.

**Published source, 2026-09-23:** remote `main` and the peeled annotated
`checkpoint/0.1.16` tag both resolve to `97938d0c874b651a7ab1b44b002b289c5c378caa`.
The exact tagged tree passed all six suites (207, 93, 53, 147, 40, 267;
direct exit 0). The reviewed source remained unchanged from `34013e3` through
the tag. This is source publication only: no live installation, private-rule
sync, native Windows/macOS acceptance, cleanup of evidence, or other-repository
change was performed. See
`docs/reports/2026-09-23-local-layer-publication-receipt.md`. The remaining
text is historical review and pre-publication handoff material.

---

**Review closeout, 2026-09-23:** pinned `34013e3` passed focused mechanical
and deep GPT-6 Sol reviews with no blocker. Its committed-tree six-suite run
passed (207, 93, 53, 147, 40, 267; direct exit 0), and its full diff check
passed. Only review records and status documents may enter the final
administrative commit; compare the reviewed source-file tree with the tag
before publishing. Then verify remote `main` and `checkpoint/0.1.16` directly.
This handoff records review readiness, not a claim that a push or live
installation occurred.

**Prior review stage:** pinned `b2fd255` passed mechanical review of the
hard-link capability repair but failed deep review on two safety-instruction
gaps: the Windows conversion example omitted `/.claude`, and the quiescence
warning was in first-install Step 0, not the update/migration routes. Both
are fixed locally with red-to-green wording tests. Focused suites pass at
147 wording, 40 wording mutations, and 267 install-preflight assertions.
The four reports and cold-read notes for `b2fd255` and `c0bd879` are preserved
under `docs/reviews/`; raw report bytes with Markdown hard breaks are also in
ignored `logs/reviews/`, while the committed copies normalize those breaks so
the whole diff check can pass. Its then-owed full suite and pinned reviews are
now complete at `34013e3`.

Earlier, the mechanical review of pinned `c0bd879` failed on
one first-install capability gap: with no managed file yet present, unsupported
`find -links` passed the guard despite the documented refusal. Its report and
cold-read note are preserved in `docs/reviews/`. A red-to-green regression now
covers the case. The deep review of `c0bd879` passed its focused security
checks; it does not override the mechanical FAIL. The next full six-suite run
passed (207, 93, 53, 144, 38, 264 assertions; direct exit 0). A fresh pinned
review of this candidate is still owed. No tag or push.

The preceding GPT-6 Sol mechanical and deep reviews of pinned
`5441cd8` both returned FAIL. They independently reproduced a forged canonical
tag lookup through inherited `GIT_DIR`; the deep review reproduced an external
overwrite through a hard-linked managed destination. Mechanical review also
found a newline-path skip and false first-install prerequisites. Their exact
reports and cold-read notes are preserved under `docs/reviews/`. Local repairs
now isolate Git environment, refuse managed hard links, reject newline paths,
and correct the prerequisite text. The full six-suite rerun passed (207, 93,
53, 144, 38, 262 assertions; direct exit 0). A pinned re-review is still owed.
The candidate remains local: no tag, push, live
install/uninstall/backup, or other-repository change. ADR 0010 records the
approved trust design; the historical seam tape below is not current status.

---

**Current:** v0.1.16 is **built, repaired and held**. The five tasks of the
local-layer plan are complete, the mechanical review's four blocking findings and
its eight minor ones are fixed, and the tests pass; nothing is published until the
batch's deep review is ruled, and the deep review of `scripts/check-local.sh` —
the risk-class task — is owed at task grain as well.

**What the fix round changed** (uncommitted in a worktree at the time of writing;
the report is `LANE-A3-REPORT.md`): an Override with no valid `**Dead words:**`
line is now exit 2, which is what makes a mistyped marker a refusal instead of a
silent pass; a local file that exists and cannot be read as a regular file is exit
2, not "nothing is customized"; a Dead-words line has a 4,096-byte bound; a file
name may carry no glob character and nothing is ever glob-expanded; the templates
ship no live entry; `INSTALL.md` asks before it copies, stages the new version
before the migration check, never copies a template over an existing local file,
and exempts the local files from the uninstall restore; and "never opens them" is
gone everywhere — the check script does open them, to read.

What 0.1.16 does: "make it yours" stopped meaning "edit the installed files".
Customizations live in `rules/LOCAL.md` and `rules/LOCAL_dev.md`, two files this
repository never ships, and that an update never writes to, copies over or
replaces. Section 0 says in one sentence
that an entry there wins over the playbook's wording — a sentence rather than a
reading order, because the harness loads `rules/` in no promised order. An entry
is a **Fill**, an **Add**, or an **Override** that quotes the dead words it
replaces, so `scripts/check-local.sh` can prove mechanically that it still bites
before an update copies anything. Decision: `docs/adr/0004-the-local-layer.md`;
guide: `docs/guides/local-layer.md`.

**Verify with:** `sh tests/run.sh` — five suites, 480 assertions, two of them
mutation harnesses over the other three.

**After publication**, the acceptance test is the script itself: run
`check-local.sh` against the owner's own local files and the published rules
(must exit 0), and confirm his installed playbook files are byte-identical to
the tag.

Where we are otherwise: the bundle is installable and swept clean of private
references. The macOS platform file is verified on real hardware; Linux and
Windows are written but unexecuted (see `BACKLOG.md`). No installed file needs
editing any more — the git identity is a Fill in the user's own `LOCAL.md`, and
the one file worth checking against their own setup is the model roster,
`rules/ROSTER.md`.

v0.1.13 made reviews non-blocking (rules 3.3 and 3.5, ADR 0001) and moved every
model name into `rules/ROSTER.md`. v0.1.14 corrected rule 3.5's accounting the
same day, after an independent review of the Codex port plan (ADR 0002); v0.1.15
corrected it again after the deep review of the finished port (ADR 0003).

**How this repository is worked (the owner's word, 2026-09-20):** every update
goes straight to `main` — no feature branches — and each task's commit gets a
`checkpoint/<VERSION>` tag, pushed. `checkpoint/0.1.13` is the first one.

The repository carries one branch, `main`, tracking `origin/main`. Before 0.1.9
the published branch was a local branch named `shipping` and the local `main`
was an unrelated abandoned root; they are now joined by a merge commit.
