# The local layer — how to make this rulebook yours without forking it

*The decision and the alternatives rejected are in
[`../adr/0004-the-local-layer.md`](../adr/0004-the-local-layer.md); the section
verifier superseding its original phrase search is in
[`../adr/0005-verifiable-local-overrides.md`](../adr/0005-verifiable-local-overrides.md).
This guide describes the current contract.*

---

## The problem it solves

This README has always said *install these rules and make them your own*. Until
version 0.1.16, "make them your own" meant editing the installed files — and
that made every update a merge. The install guide had to say "stop and ask
before replacing anything", and you had to re-apply your tailoring by hand or
stay behind.

The cost was measured on one real installation: a hand-merged fork of this
playbook, kept by hand for weeks. Of fourteen shared rule files, three were
byte-identical to upstream, seven differed by two to eight lines, and four
differed substantially. And the fork had drifted the wrong way — it still
carried a rule number from a numbering scheme retired a week earlier, and
wording this playbook had since improved.

**Hand-merging loses upstream fixes silently.** That is the failure the local
layer exists to prevent.

The same measurement showed something useful about the differences: almost all
of them *supplied a value*, *bound a generic term to something the person
actually had*, or *added a rule the playbook lacks*. Very few changed what a
rule says. So the design does not need to be a merge tool. It needs three kinds
of entry and one check.

## The two files

| Your file | Loads | For |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.claude/rules/LOCAL.md` | every session | everything |
| `~/.claude/rules/LOCAL_dev.md` | with the six source-scoped sections | entries about sections 1, 2, 3, 6, 8 and the roster |

Start from `templates/LOCAL.md` and `templates/LOCAL_dev.md` in this repository.
**If you have only a few lines of customization, create only the first file.**
A local file that is absent means nothing is customized.

The second file exists for one reason. The playbook deliberately scopes six of
its files — `CODE`, `TESTING`, `REVIEWS`, `WORKFLOW`, `SUBAGENTS`, `ROSTER` — to
source work, so a session that never opens a source file does not pay for
development and review detail. Most of a heavy customizer's entries are about
exactly those sections. Putting them all in `LOCAL.md` would load every one of
them in every session and throw that property away.

`LOCAL_dev.md` therefore carries the **same `paths:` frontmatter** as those six
files, byte for byte. If it drifts, the file arrives at different moments than
the rules it modifies — and an entry can be missing precisely when its rule is
being read. `tests/rules_text_test.sh` compares the blocks.

## Why precedence is a sentence, not a reading order

The obvious design is "read the local file last, so it wins". It does not work.
The harness loads every file under `rules/` with **no promised order**, and
nothing in a Markdown file can change that.

Section 0, `rules/AUTHORITY.md`, under *The local layer*, defines the limits
regardless of reading order: entries may fill open values, add non-authorizing
guidance, or tighten constraints. They never expand authority, remove approval,
relax safety or secret-handling protections, change precedence, or override the
paragraph that sets those limits.

Each of the six source-scoped files carries one line pointing back at that
boundary, because a session may be reading one of them without section 0 in
front of it.

**Adding a row to the approval table does not create an exception to that
boundary.** The local layer has only the authority section 0 gives it.

## The three kinds of entry

### Fill — supply a value the rule leaves open

The commonest kind, and the cheapest: it creates no second text at all.

```markdown
- **Fill — rule 9.1, the registry home.** The claims registry here is
  `~/.config/my-fleet/ports/`, one file per project; machine-specific gotchas
  live in `~/.config/my-fleet/machine.md`.
```

Use it for the generic terms the rules leave deliberately open: where your port
registry lives, which tool implements a procedure, what "the deep-tier model"
means in your setup, which channel is "the owner's channel".

**Your git identity is a Fill.** It is the one value the playbook ships blank.
`templates/LOCAL.md` carries the entry as a **fenced example**, deliberately: a
template ships no live entry, because a copy taken as shipped would otherwise
bind your agent to "commits use [nothing]". Copy it out of the fence and put your
own address in it. It lives in `LOCAL.md` rather than `LOCAL_dev.md` because a
commit is not always a source touch.

### Add — a rule the playbook does not have

It supplies non-authorizing guidance or a stricter constraint.

```markdown
## L1 · Housekeeping

- **Add — nothing but rule files lives under `rules/`.** Claude Code loads that
  folder recursively, so any Markdown file in any subfolder becomes law in every
  session. Backups go to `~/.claude/rules-backups/`; drafts go to a repo.
```

**Number your own sections `L1`, `L2`, …** The playbook promises never to use an
`L` number, so your numbering and its numbering cannot collide as either grows.

An Add is also the right shape for provenance — *why* a rule is there for you,
whose word it was, what incident produced it. That kind of note is worth
keeping and is nobody else's business.

### Override — change a named rule within the local-layer boundary

The only kind that leaves two texts alive for one rule, so it carries the most
obligation. It must:

1. **name the rule** it changes;
2. **say what is different in whole sentences** — not a diff, not a patch;
3. carry an `**Anchor:**` naming one literal Markdown heading that occurs
   exactly once in one managed file;
4. carry a `**Rule digest:**` with the SHA-256 digest of that normalized section;
5. carry a `**Dead words:**` quote of at least 16 non-whitespace bytes, occurring
   exactly once inside that section and naming the same file;
6. say which playbook version it was written against.

```markdown
- **Override — rule 9.1, recheck before binding.** In addition to checking
  availability before assigning a port, repeat the machine and registry checks
  immediately before binding it. Written against 0.1.16.
  **Anchor:** `# 9 · Environment & operations — rules 9.1–9.7` (in `ENVIRONMENT.md`)
  **Rule digest:** `sha256:ec11fbd600bf11141505de99cc655e84f3140e1b5332c2abee7c4dec14f0ec3e`
  **Dead words:** `before assigning a port, verify it's free` (in `ENVIRONMENT.md`)
```

**Why quote dead words rather than replace the whole rule?** Because replacing a
rule to change one clause freezes the rest of it. Rule 3.5 is twenty kilobytes
and changed five times in a single day; an override that had copied it would
have silently held four of those revisions out. Quoting keeps an override as
small as the disagreement. The digest detects changes elsewhere in that same
section even when the quoted words survive.

## The staleness check

An Override is bound to a section and a quotation. If either changes, it is
**stale and suspended**. Re-read the rule before refreshing the entry; until
then apply the stricter constraint and hold the affected action for the owner.
Run a checkout's copy of the checker only after `INSTALL.md`'s source-trust
preflight has authenticated that checkout and its script bytes.

```sh
sh scripts/check-local.sh <local-dir> <rules-dir> [claude-md-path]
```

For each live Override, the checker extracts the section from its heading
through the line before the next heading of equal or higher level. It
normalizes CRLF to LF and removes trailing spaces and tabs, verifies the
section's SHA-256 digest, and requires its substantial quote to occur exactly
once inside that section as a fixed string. A standalone `**Dead words:**` line
is only a non-authorizing compatibility probe against a named file; it cannot
activate an Override. The checker never modifies local or managed text.

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **0** | every section digest and quote is current — or there is no local layer; this does not establish that an entry is authorized |
| **1** | at least one changed section digest or missing quote; the affected Override is suspended |
| **2** | invalid input or an unavailable check: incomplete verifier, ambiguous heading, short or repeated quote, missing file, malformed or oversized line, unsupported entry shape, UTF-8 BOM or NUL byte, misplaced marker, unclosed fence, unreadable local file, missing hash tool, or failed search |

**Exit 2 is never a pass.** A line the check cannot read is a check that stopped
checking, and the update stops on it exactly as it stops on a stale override.
That is why an unreadable local file — a mode the copy of a file can arrive with,
or a directory where a file should be — is an error and not "nothing is
customized": the difference between "no override went stale" and "no override was
looked at" is the whole value of the check.

The second argument is the point of the design: **point it at the staged new
text**, before anything is copied. `INSTALL.md` first authenticates that
checkout against the canonical published tag, or a full fork commit pin the
owner explicitly supplied, before it executes the staged checker. Offline or
unverifiable source refuses. The update then fails *before* it can surprise
you rather than after.

### The grammar, because a script reads it

```
  **Dead words:** `some exact words` (in `FILE.md`) · `other words` (in `A.md` and `B.md`)
```

- Optional leading whitespace, then the literal `**Dead words:**`, then a space
  or a tab, then the first item.
- Items separated by ` · ` — space, middle dot, space.
- Each item: one code span of the quoted words, then ` (in `, then one or more
  code spans naming files, then `)`. Several names join with `, `, ` and `, or
  `, and `. **Every item names its file**; one that names none is an error.
- Quoted words may not contain a backtick and may not be empty, and are taken
  **verbatim between the backticks** — never trimmed, never re-split. A file
  name carries no whitespace, no `/` and no glob character (`*`, `?`, `[`) — a
  name is a name, never a pattern matched against whatever directory the check
  was run from: it names a file in the rules directory,
  and `CLAUDE.md` means the playbook's front page, which resolves to the parent
  of the rules directory (or to an explicit third argument). **No item may name
  a path outside those two places** — `../CLAUDE.md` is rejected on purpose.
- After the last item, one closing `.` is allowed, and so is trailing
  whitespace. Any other trailing text is an error.
- Lines inside a fenced code block are skipped, so your file can quote this
  grammar without the example being checked. A fence that is never closed is an
  error: everything after it was ignored.
- Whitespace before the line and after the last item is ignored — an invisible
  trailing space should not halt an update. Whitespace *inside* the grammar is
  not ignored: a doubled space is an error.
- The whole line may be at most **4,096 bytes**. The longest real one measured is
  under a kilobyte; past the bound it is a runaway paste, and the bound fails
  closed rather than handing an unbounded string to `grep`.

**The line is scanned, never split.** A real entry quotes
`` `### 11 · Your platform` ``, so the separator, `(in ` and `)` all occur
*inside* quoted words; only a backtick ends a code span. The first implementation
split the line on ` · ` and refused eight of the ten entries in the author's own
local files — which is how this paragraph came to exist.

**And the check fails closed.** The bare marker anywhere but the start of a line
is an **error**, never a skipped entry: an override buried mid-line would
otherwise be dropped in silence, and a staleness check that silently checks
nothing is worse than none. Prose that needs to name the marker puts it inside a
code span, as this guide does throughout.

**An Override with no complete verifier is an error too**, reported at the
Override's own line. This is what makes a mistyped marker — `**dead words:**`,
`**Dead words**:`, a bare `Dead words:` — a refusal instead of a silent pass:
without it, one wrong character turns an override into a thing nothing can ever
call stale. The check looks for the verifier between the Override and the next entry
or the next heading, where an *entry* is a line that (after optional indentation
and an optional `- ` or `* ` bullet) begins with `**Fill`, `**Add` or
`**Override`. A Fill and an Add owe nothing: they leave no second text to go
stale. An Override written inside a fenced code block is an example and owes
nothing either — which is why every example in this guide and in the templates is
fenced. A `**Dead words:**` line with no Override above it is still parsed and
searched: it is the Override that owes its words, not the words that owe an
Override.

### What the check cannot do

It catches changes throughout the anchored section, including unquoted text.
It cannot judge whether an entry expands authority or relaxes protection, or
detect a semantic dependency changed in another section. A matching digest is
evidence of freshness, never evidence of permission.

That is why `INSTALL.md`'s update procedure has a second step: list, from
`CHANGELOG.md`, every rule the update touched that you override, and read those.
The two steps answer different questions; running one is not running both.

## Installing, updating, migrating

All three procedures are in [`../../INSTALL.md`](../../INSTALL.md), written to be
executed by an agent or a person. In short:

- **Install** — authenticate the published checkout and real destination
  roots, then copy `CLAUDE.md` and `rules/*.md`, one platform file, and offer
  the two templates. Nothing installed needs editing.
- **Update** — stage and authenticate the new text, run the check against it,
  stop on 1 or 2,
  list the overridden rules the changelog touched, back up to a *sibling* of
  `rules/`, then copy file by file. The playbook never ships your two files, and
  an update never writes to them, copies over them, or replaces them — the check
  reads them, and only to check them. The update asks you before it copies
  anything.
- **Migrate** — for an installation tailored the old way: authenticate both
  staged checkouts, then diff it against the published text *of the version it
  records*, turn each difference into a Fill,
  an Add, an Override or an upstream candidate, get the list approved, prove it
  with the check, then install.
- **Uninstall or restore** — stop while either local path remains active under
  `rules/`, including Fill-only and Add-only files. The owner must decide how to
  preserve those files outside the loaded directory before removing their base.

## Keeping a local layer honest

**Send entries upstream.** An entry that would be a better rule for everyone
belongs in this repository, and then leaves your local file. A local layer that
grows into a second rulebook has stopped doing its job — you are back to
maintaining a fork, with extra steps.

**Record the version an Override was written against.** When you read it a year
later, that line is what tells you whether it was ever re-examined.

**Keep `LOCAL.md` short.** It loads in every session, so everything in it is
paid for whether or not it is needed. Anything about code, tests, reviews,
workflow, subagents or the roster belongs in `LOCAL_dev.md`.

**Never put anything else under `rules/`.** Not a backup, not a draft, not a
note. The folder loads recursively; a Markdown file saved there becomes law in
every session.

## How it was proven

The original design was installed on the owner's own rules on 2026-09-21 — the
hand-merged fork described at the top of this guide, converted entry by entry —
and tested in two fresh sessions started outside any project:

- the always-loaded file answered with no source file touched;
- the source-scoped file arrived only when a source file was opened;
- where the two texts disagreed, the local entry won.

Those historical checks predate the current authority boundary and section
verifier. They do not establish runtime acceptance of the repaired contract.

The check itself is covered by `tests/check_local_test.sh`, and that suite is
covered by `tests/mutation_test.sh`, which breaks one behaviour of the script at
a time in a scratch copy and requires the suite to notice. A green suite proves
nothing on its own.
