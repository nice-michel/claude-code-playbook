# Backlog

Dated one-liners for everything deferred or spotted and not done.

- **2026-10-07 · test defect · open** — `install_preflight_test` fails 14/291 on stock
  macOS: `make_tmpdir` returns a `/var/...` path (a symlink) and the destination guard
  refuses linked ancestors. Fix: return `pwd -P`. Second failing suite of `tests/run.sh`
  unconfirmed. Source: `docs/handoffs/2026-10-07-test-suite-fails-on-stock-macos.md`.
- **2026-10-05 · context budget · open** — the always-loaded playbook set is ~70k
  characters on macOS, nearly half of Claude Code's 150k instruction limit, and
  0.1.23 pushed `AUTHORITY.md` back to 20k. Propose a size-budget test (~40k),
  an entries-only `LOCAL.md` template, and a re-measure of ADR 0011. Task 4 of
  `docs/plans/2026-10-05-instruction-budget-plan.md`; needs its own go.
  Source: otel-mtls budget warning, 2026-10-05.
- **2026-09-27 · plan · open** — the behaviour-suite plan
  (`docs/plans/2026-09-26-behaviour-suite-plan.md`, still untracked) reserves
  ADRs 0014–0018; ADR 0014 went to hygiene and ADR 0015 to dev modes, so its numbers become 0016–0020
  when it is recorded, and it gains a hygiene scenario pair (a refused cleanup
  that must not be re-spelled; a worktree with an ignored `.env`). Its size
  (small / lean / full) awaits the owner. Source: v0.1.21.

- **2026-09-26 · idea · open** — an owner-side hook that injects the dev rules
  when code outside the project is edited would make ADR 0012's duty
  deterministic. The playbook ships rules, not harness settings, so it stays an
  idea for the owner's own setup. Source: v0.1.18.
- **2026-09-26 · verification · done 2026-09-26** — answered by measurement: the glob
  does not fire for a vault outside the project (0/2); read-by-path is the
  mechanism (ADR 0012, `docs/reports/2026-09-26-loading-measurements.md`).
  Original question: whether `QUARANTINE.md`'s `paths:`
  glob (`**/.quarantine/**`) auto-loads the file when the agent touches a vault
  outside the project root, as `~/.quarantine/` is. Not relied upon: the
  always-loaded `DESTRUCTIVE.md` sends the agent to the file by path. Needs one
  fresh-session test. Source: v0.1.17, ADR 0011.
- **2026-09-26 · context budget · open** — in a session opened inside this
  repository the front page loads twice: the project `CLAUDE.md` is the shipped
  front page, on top of the installed `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (+8.4 KB). Only this
  repository's sessions pay it; fixing it means moving the shipped front page
  out of the repository root, which changes the installer's source paths.
  Source: v0.1.17 measurement.
- **2026-09-26 · context budget · open** — no token counter was available for the
  0.1.17 measurement; the byte counts are exact, the token figures (3.5–4 bytes
  per token) are estimates. Measure with the token-counting API when a key is
  available. Source: v0.1.17.

- **2026-09-21 · owner's own files · open** — with the corrected parser, the
  author's installed `~/.claude/rules/LOCAL.md` still has two lines the check
  refuses, and both refusals are correct. Line 9 is prose that names the bare
  marker in the middle of a sentence; it needs the marker wrapped in a code span,
  the way `templates/LOCAL.md` now writes it. Line 39 is an Override whose
  Dead-words entry names no file (`` `~/.config/agent-rules/`. `` with nothing
  after it); it needs `` (in `ENVIRONMENT.md`) ``. Nine of the ten quoted strings
  in that layer were searched and none was stale. The two fixes are the owner's
  file to make, not this repository's. Source: v0.1.16, lane A2.
- **2026-09-21 · shared grammar · done 2026-09-21** — the Oxford joiner `, and `
  between file names inside one item was accepted by this edition with no shared
  conformance vector covering it, so the two editions could have implemented it
  differently without any test noticing. Vector 47 (`three files, comma before
  and`) now covers it, and ADR 0004's completion paragraph names all three
  joiners. Source: v0.1.16, lane A2; closed by lane A3's re-check.
- **2026-09-21 · rule question · open** — section numbers are now a shared
  namespace: the playbook owns `0`–`12` and promises never to use `L1`, `L2`, …,
  which the local layer owns. The platform section keeps number 11, and an
  installation that needs its own meaning for a playbook section number has to
  say so with an Override rather than by renumbering. Nothing enforces the
  promise; a check that no shipped rule file defines an `L` section would.
  Source: ADR 0004, v0.1.16.
- **2026-09-21 · verification · open** — `scripts/check-local.sh` has been run
  under `dash` and under `bash` in POSIX mode on Linux only. It has not been run
  on macOS (BSD `grep`) or under `busybox ash`. The flags it relies on are all
  POSIX (`grep -F -q -e --`), but that is an argument, not a measurement.
  Source: v0.1.16.
- **2026-09-21 · hygiene · partly closed 2026-09-23** — ADR 0005's section
  digest catches changes to unquoted text within the anchored section. Changes
  to semantic dependencies in other sections still require `INSTALL.md` U3's
  owner review; the checker cannot decide authority. Source: ADR 0004
  consequences, v0.1.16; focused blocker repair.
- **2026-09-21 · wording · open** — three *titles* still say the playbook "never
  touches" the local files, which the corrected wording elsewhere replaced with
  "never ships them, and an update never writes to, copies over or replaces them":
  ADR 0004's heading, its line in `docs/adr/README.md`, and the matching title of
  the local-layer entry in `docs/index.html`'s dataset. Every *claim* in those
  places is fixed; only the labels are left, and ADR 0004's heading is accepted
  history that is superseded rather than edited. Closing this means agreeing a new
  title for the ADR's successor, or accepting the label as shorthand. Source:
  v0.1.16, lane A3.
- **2026-09-21 · verification · open** — one mutation of `scripts/check-local.sh`
  cannot be killed on this machine: removing `LC_ALL=C`. Measured under `dash`
  with GNU `grep` 3.11 and `LC_ALL=C.utf8` in the environment, a quotation
  containing invalid UTF-8 bytes is found identically with and without the
  assignment — `dash` is byte-oriented for every string operation, and GNU
  `grep -F` is byte-transparent. The line is kept because it is load-bearing under
  `bash` (where `${#line}`, which measures the 4,096-byte bound, counts characters
  in a UTF-8 locale) and on a `grep` that collates. Killing it needs a non-GNU
  `grep` or a `bash`-run suite; it is the same gap as the macOS item above.
  Source: v0.1.16, lane A3.
- **2026-09-21 · hygiene · open** — the version now has **five** carriers:
  `VERSION`, the line in `CLAUDE.md`, the README table, the eyebrow in
  `docs/index.html`, and the "Written against **playbook &lt;VERSION&gt;**" line in
  both templates. The templates carry a literal placeholder rather than a
  number, so they do not drift — but the other four still do. Widens the
  existing four-carrier item below. Source: v0.1.16.

- **2026-09-14 · verification · open** — `rules/platform/LINUX.md` commands have
  not been executed on Linux. Source: generalisation task. Needs one pass on a
  real Linux box.
- **2026-09-14 · verification · open** — `rules/platform/WINDOWS.md` commands
  have not been executed on Windows. The load-average mismatch found during
  review is now handled in-file (CPU% / 100, never also divided by cores, with
  0.85 as the heavy band), but that arithmetic has not been checked against a
  real busy Windows machine.
- **2026-09-14 · idea · open** — an install script (Unix shell + PowerShell)
  that backs up an existing `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` before copying. Deliberately
  not written yet: it touches a file the user created, which rule 10.2 says to
  handle carefully, so it deserves its own small design rather than a
  convenience one-liner.
- **2026-09-14 · idea · open** — a short worked example showing one task running
  the full close-out chain end to end. The rules describe the chain; a new reader
  would benefit from seeing one.
- **2026-09-14 · hygiene · open** — the version now has **four** carriers:
  `VERSION`, the line in `CLAUDE.md`, the README table, and the eyebrow in
  `docs/index.html`. They drift — the published map shipped one version behind at
  v0.1.7 and had to be caught by hand. A check comparing all four before a commit
  is the fix; not written yet. Source: v0.1.4, widened v0.1.7.
- **2026-09-14 · rule question · open** — `INSTALL.md` requires a verified backup
  before overwriting anything, and treats a failed backup as a refusal. Applying
  the v0.1.7 fix overwrote two *already-installed* files without one, on the
  reasoning that both were byte-identical to a published tag and so trivially
  recoverable. That reasoning was not written down and the guide grants no such
  exception. Either add one — "an update may skip the backup when every file it
  replaces is byte-identical to a published tag" — or the rule stands as written.
  Needs a ruling; source: the first real install.
- **2026-09-15 · review · open** — the recovered report
  `docs/reports/2026-09-14-generalisation-conventions.md` came from the abandoned
  0.1.1 history and describes generalisation conventions as they stood before
  0.1.2. It has not been read against the current rules and may document
  superseded decisions. Either confirm it still holds, mark it historical, or
  supersede it. Source: the history merge in 0.1.9.
- **2026-09-15 · hygiene · open** — `PROGRESS.md` had drifted eight versions
  (stuck at "v0.1.0") in both histories before 0.1.9 touched it, which is the
  same drift already logged for the four version carriers. Whatever check gets
  written for those should cover `PROGRESS.md`'s own header line too.
- **2026-09-15 · rule change · awaiting decision** — the per-task documentation
  chain is expensive, and the fix is frequency plus a script, not a cheaper
  model. Full analysis, five options, the concrete rule edits and four batched
  questions in `docs/reports/2026-09-15-documentation-chain-cost.md`. Deferred by
  Michel to a session with budget to do it properly. Supersedes the narrower
  "version carriers drift" item above, which is Option 2 of this report.
- **2026-09-20 · measurement · open** — the ceiling of three unruled batches per line,
  the open one included (rule 3.5), and the claim that a deep review lasts "one to three tasks" rest on
  one programme, a behaviour-preserving refactor. Needs the close-out metric
  (how often a line carried three unruled batches, and how often a batch was
  admitted with two already carried) from at least one feature-work programme
  with real dependencies before the number is treated as settled. Source: v0.1.13,
  ADR 0001.
- **2026-09-20 · verification · open** — *why* context crossed the blind-review
  boundary between a session and its in-process subagent is a hypothesis
  (session-level injection: task notifications, file-change notices, memory,
  diagnostics), untested. One test settles it: give an in-process subagent a
  scratch directory outside the project and record which channels still fire.
  Rule 3.3 states only the effect until then. Source: v0.1.13.
- **2026-09-20 · rule question · open** — the roster gained a Strong tier between
  Standard and Top. Rule 8.1 still says risk domains (security, concurrency,
  unsafe code) *start on the Top tier* for implementation. With a Strong tier
  available, should they start there instead, keeping the Top tier for planning
  and review? Not decided; the wording was left as it was. Source: v0.1.13.
- **2026-09-20 · hygiene · open** — the roster now has **three** display copies
  besides `rules/ROSTER.md`: the README table, the published page, and ADR 0001's
  prose. The first two are marked as copies and will drift exactly as the version
  carriers do; the check proposed for those should cover the roster too, and the
  rule count ("fifty") in README, `docs/ANNOUNCE.md` and the page. Source: v0.1.13.
- **2026-09-20 · discrepancy · half closed 2026-09-20** — *the owner's word the
  same day: this repo carries `checkpoint/<VERSION>` tags, and every update goes
  straight to `main`. `checkpoint/0.1.13` was then created on the 0.1.13 commit
  and pushed. Still open: what happened to the four earlier tags.* The 0.1.9 and 0.1.11
  changelog entries say four tags were published to the remote. On 2026-09-20
  `git tag -l` and `git ls-remote --tags origin` both return nothing, and there
  are no GitHub releases. Either the tags were removed afterwards (which rule 6.4
  forbids and the changelog does not record) or those entries are wrong. v0.1.13
  was therefore **not tagged** — adding one is reversible, removing one is not.
  Needs the owner's word: what happened to the tags, and should this repo carry
  `checkpoint/` tags at all. Source: v0.1.13 close-out.
- **2026-09-20 · hygiene · open** — 0.1.13's check that no model is named outside
  `rules/ROSTER.md` searched for capitalised names and passed while a lower-case example sat
  in `rules/WORKFLOW.md`. A passing check is a claim about the check. Whatever script is
  written for the version and roster carriers should search case-insensitively, and should be
  shown failing on a planted example before it is trusted. Source: v0.1.14.
